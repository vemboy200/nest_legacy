This is a custom component for Home Assistant to integrate a wide range of Nest devices using an unofficial web API (combining REST streaming and Protobuf). It serves as an alternative to the official Nest integration, providing support for devices not available through Google's official Smart Device Management (SDM) API, such as the Nest Protect, Nest x Yale Lock, and Nest Heat Link.

This integration provides real-time updates for most sensors and controls by maintaining persistent connections to the Nest API.

## Why use Nest Legacy?

The official Home Assistant Nest integration uses Google's Smart Device Management (SDM) API, which has a limited set of supported devices and requires a one-time $5 fee. This **Nest Legacy** integration uses the same unofficial APIs that the Nest mobile and web apps use, offering several key advantages.

### Comparison with the Official Nest Integration

| Feature                  | Nest Legacy (This Integration)                                  | Official Nest Integration (SDM API)                            |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **API Used**             | Unofficial Nest Web API (REST & Protobuf)                       | Official Google SDM API                                        |
| **Cost**                 | Free                                                            | $5 USD one-time fee required by Google                         |
| **Authentication**       | Access Token (Nest Account) or Cookies (Google Account)         | OAuth2 with Google Cloud Project                               |
| **Supported Devices**    | Wider range, including **Nest Protect**, **Nest Temp Sensors**, **Nest x Yale Locks**, and **Nest Heat Link**. | Limited to newer Thermostats, Cameras, and Doorbells.         |
| **Data Updates**         | Push-based (Subscriber/Observer)                                | Push-based (Pub/Sub)                                           |
| **Stability**            | Relies on an unofficial API that could change or break without notice. | Officially supported by Google, more stable long-term.        |

**In short, use this integration if you want to:**

- Integrate Nest Protects, Temperature Sensors, Locks, or Heat Links.
- Avoid the $5 Google API fee.
- Access features not exposed by the official API (e.g., Protect component health tests, Heat Link boost, controlling Thermostat via specific Temp Sensors).

## Supported Devices

## Features & Entities

This integration creates a rich set of entities for your Nest devices based on their capabilities.

### Nest Thermostat

- **Climate:** Full control over temperature, HVAC modes (Heat, Cool, Heat/Cool, Off), and Presets (None, Eco). Supports Target Humidity if a humidifier/dehumidifier is present.
- **Fan:** Independent control of the fan (On/Off, Speed/Percentage).
- **Sensors:** Current Temperature, Target Temperature, Humidity, Target Humidity, Backplate Temperature, Filter Runtime.
- **Binary Sensors:** Occupancy, Leaf status (Eco indicator), Filter Replacement Needed.
- **Switches:** Temperature Lock, Dehumidifier State.

### Nest Temperature Sensor

- **Sensors:** Current Temperature, Battery Level.
- **Switch:** **Control Thermostat** (Active Sensor). Turning this switch on forces the associated thermostat to use this sensor's reading for climate control.

### Nest Protect

- **Binary Sensors:** Smoke Status, CO Status, Heat Status.
- **Diagnostic Binary Sensors:** Battery Health, Line Power (wired only), Occupancy (wired only), Removed from Base status.
- **Component Tests:** Sensors indicating pass/fail for Speaker, Smoke, CO, WiFi, LED, PIR, Buzzer, and Humidity sensors.
- **Sensors:** Battery Level (%), Replace By Date, Last Manual Test time, Last Audio Self-Test time.
- **Switches:** Nightly Promise (Green LED), Heads-Up Alerts, Steam Check, Night Light enable.
- **Select:** Night Light Brightness (Low, Medium, High).

### Nest Cameras & Doorbells

- **Camera:** Live streaming entity.
- **Switches:** Streaming Enabled, Audio Recording, Indoor Chime (Doorbell), Visitor Announcements (Doorbell), Night Vision (IR), Status LED, Video Rotation.
- **Events:** `event` entities that trigger on Motion, Person, Sound, Face Detection, and Doorbell Chime.
- **Media Browser:** Browse, play, and see thumbnails for historical camera events directly in the Home Assistant Media Browser.

### Nest x Yale Lock

- **Lock:** Lock and unlock control.
- **Sensors:** Battery Level, Last Actor (who locked/unlocked: Keypad, Manual, Remote, Voice, etc.).
- **Binary Sensor:** Tamper detection.
- **Switch:** Auto-Relock enable/disable.
- **Number:** Configure the Auto-Relock duration (seconds).

### Nest Heat Link (Europe)

- **Water Heater:** Control hot water heating.
- **Operation Modes:** Supports `off`, `schedule`, and several boost durations (`boost`, `boost_30m`, `boost_1h`, `boost_2h`).
- **Boost Mode:** Activates hot water for a specified duration (default 30 minutes for `boost`). The reported operation mode will dynamically update to reflect the remaining boost time (e.g., switching from `Boost (2h)` to `Boost (1h)` as time passes). Once the boost timer expires, the device automatically reverts to the previous mode (e.g., `schedule`).
- **Features:** Set target temperature, toggle Away mode.
- **Automation:** You can trigger a boost via automation using the `water_heater.set_operation_mode` action:

  ```yaml
  automation:
    triggers:
      - trigger: time
        at: "07:15:00"
    actions:
      - action: water_heater.set_operation_mode
        target:
          entity_id: water_heater.nest_heat_link
        data:
          operation_mode: boost_1h # Boost for 1 hour
  ```

### Structure (Home)

- **Select:** Set the structure mode (Home, Away, Sleep, Vacation).

## Custom Actions

This integration provides several custom actions for advanced functionality, especially for managing guest access on Nest x Yale Locks.

### `nest_legacy.list_guests`

## Installation

### HACS

This integration is included in the default HACS repository.

1. Open HACS in Home Assistant.
2. Search for "Nest Legacy" in the Integrations section and click download.
3. Restart Home Assistant.
4. Go to Settings > Devices & Services > Add Integration > Search for "Nest Legacy".

## Configuration

After installation, the integration can be configured via the Home Assistant UI.

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and start setting up a new integration.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=nest_legacy)

You will be asked to select your account type. Follow the instructions below based on your account.

### Option A: Google Account

For accounts migrated to Google, or created after August 2019. You will need to retrieve an `issue_token` and `cookies` from your browser.

⚠️ **CRITICAL BROWSER WARNING:** **Do NOT use Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge** to get these cookies. Chromium-based browsers use aggressive, hardware-bound security sessions with Google. If you use Chrome, your integration will authenticate successfully but will fail after a few hours or immediately upon restarting Home Assistant. Spoofing the User-Agent in Chrome will not bypass this.
**You MUST use Safari or Firefox** to capture a long-lived cookie.

#### Recommended Method: Nest Token Extractor (Easiest)

We recommend using the **[Nest Token Extractor](https://github.com/tronikos/nest-token-extractor)** browser extension to automatically capture and format these credentials for you in seconds.
1. Install the extension for **Firefox** or **Safari** (do not use Chrome).
2. Open the extension, choose your environment, and click **Open Nest & Start Extraction**.
3. Sign in to your account. Copy the extracted **Issue Token** and **Cookies** straight into Home Assistant!
4. *Firefox Users:* If the Cookies field remains blank, click the **Shield** icon in your Firefox address bar on `home.nest.com` and toggle off **Enhanced Tracking Protection**, then retry.

#### Manual Method

(Instructions adapted from the `homebridge-nest` project).

1. Open a **Safari** or **Firefox** browser tab.
   - **Do NOT use Private/Incognito mode in Firefox**, as it enforces strict cookie isolation that will result in a "No active session found" error, even if tracking protection is disabled.
   - **Firefox Users:** You **MUST** click on the **Shield** icon in the Firefox address bar on `home.nest.com` and uncheck/toggle off **Enhanced Tracking Protection** (both on `home.nest.com` and `accounts.google.com` if prompted). If ETP is enabled, Firefox blocks or isolates Google's cookies inside the nested iframe, resulting in `Invalid authentication` in Home Assistant.
2. Open Developer Tools (usually right-click -> Inspect, or in Safari: Develop -> Show Web Inspector).
3. Click on the **Network** tab. Make sure **Preserve Log** (or "Persist Logs") is checked.
4. In the 'Filter' box, enter `issueToken`.
5. Go to `home.nest.com`, and click **Sign in with Google**. Log into your account.
6. One network call (beginning with `iframerpc`) will appear in the Dev Tools window. Click on it.
7. In the **Headers** tab, under **General** (or "Headers" in Safari), copy the entire **Request URL**. This is your `Issue token`.
8. Clear the filter box and now enter `oauth2/iframe`.
9. Several network calls will appear. Click on the **last `iframe` call**.
10. In the **Headers** tab, under **Request Headers**, find the `cookie` entry. Copy the **entire cookie string** (it will be very long). This is your `Cookies`.
11. Paste these values into the Home Assistant configuration form.
12. **Do not log out of `home.nest.com`**, as this will immediately invalidate your credentials. Just close the browser tab.

### Option B: Legacy Nest Account

For older, non-migrated Nest accounts. You will need to obtain an `access_token`.

1. Go to `https://home.nest.com` in your browser and log in.
2. Once logged in, open a new tab and go to `https://home.nest.com/session`.
3. You will see a long string of text. Find `"access_token": "..."` near the beginning.
4. Copy the value inside the quotes (it's a long sequence of letters, numbers and punctuation beginning with `b`). This is your `Access token`.
5. Paste this value into the Home Assistant configuration form.
6. **Do not log out of `home.nest.com`**, as this will invalidate your credentials. Just close the browser tab.

### Field Test Environment

If you are part of the Google Field Test program, check the "Use Field Test environment" box during setup.

### Configuration Options

Once set up, you can click "Configure" on the integration entry to tweak settings:

- **Camera Event Poll Interval:** How often to check for new camera events (default: 5 seconds).
- **Protobuf Options:** Enable/Disable the use of the newer Protobuf API for specific device types (Locks, Thermostats, Protects, Structure, Cameras).

## Troubleshooting

- **Authentication Errors:** If you receive authentication errors, your cookies or tokens may have expired. You will need to re-fetch them using the steps above and use the "Reconfigure" option in the integration.
- **"No active session found" / Invalid authentication on setup:** If your debug logs show `BadCredentialsException('No active session found.')`, the cookies you provided did not contain a valid Google login session. This is almost always caused by browser privacy settings (like Firefox's Enhanced Tracking Protection) or using a Private/Incognito window which isolates cross-site cookies. Try again in a normal window (you can create a fresh browser profile if you want to avoid logging out of your primary account) or use the recommended **Nest Token Extractor** extension.
- **Missing Devices:** Ensure your devices are visible in the Nest app. Some newer Google Nest devices (like the 2021+ battery cameras) are exclusively on the Google Home app and may not appear here, or may have limited functionality via the legacy API.
